        <h1>This page is about light</h1>
        <p>Light, the radiant energy that illuminates our world, is a form of electromagnetic radiation that allows us to perceive the beauty and complexity of our surroundings.
              From the warm glow of the sun to the intricate patterns of a laser beam, light exists in a spectrum of wavelengths, each carrying different amounts of energy and 
              contributing to the vibrant tapestry of colors we see.  It travels in waves and also behaves as particles, a duality that has fascinated scientists for centuries and 
              continues to unlock the secrets of the universe.</p>
