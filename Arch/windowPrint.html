    <h2>The window.print() Method</h2>
    <p>The manager accused the employee of being "flexible" with company funds, 
        implying dishonesty, but when confronted about the seriousness of the 
        claim, he shifted to saying the employee was merely "flexible" in finding
         creative solutions to financial challenges. This equivocal invocation of 
         the term "flexible" allows the manager to make an insinuation without being
          held accountable for its more negative interpretation, potentially 
          damaging the employee's reputation while avoiding a direct accusation. 
          This tactic can be misleading and unfair, as it exploits the ambiguity 
          of language to imply something without taking responsibility for theÂ implication.</p>
