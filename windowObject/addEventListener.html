<h1>The Window Object</h1>
<h2>The addEventListener() Method</h2>
<p>This example adds two click events to the window.</p>
<p>Click anywhere in the document.</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
    window.addEventListener("click", myFunction1);
    window.addEventListener("click", myFunction2);

    function myFunction1() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "First function was executed! "
    }

    function myFunction2() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Second function was executed! "
    }
    /*  Other Mouse Events
These are useful if you want more nuanced control over user interaction:
- "dblclick" — triggers on double-click
- "mousedown" — when mouse button is pressed
- "mouseup" — when mouse button is released
- "mousemove" — when the mouse moves
- "mouseenter" / "mouseleave" — when the mouse enters or leaves an element
- "mouseover" / "mouseout" — when the mouse is over or out of an element
- "contextmenu" — when the right mouse button is clicked (opens context menu)*/
